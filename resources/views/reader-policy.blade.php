<p>11.&nbsp;<strong>Access Sensitive Information - Background Location Permission</strong></p>

<p>This is a product delivery app and it need background permission all the time while user turns online.  using this permission the customer(using another app) and business can track the delivery man location even the app is in background or the phone is locked. This permission is very important for the flow of business and delivery module.</p>

<p>An app requires background location access if a feature within the app constantly shares location with other users or uses the Geofencing API. Several examples include the following:</p>

<p>The system considers your app to be using background location if it accesses the device's current location in any situation other than the ones described in the foreground location section. The background location precision is the same as the foreground location precision, which depends on the location permissions that your app declares.</p>

<p>On earlier versions of Android, when your app receives foreground location access, it automatically receives background location access as well.</p>
